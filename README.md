This is a repository for configuring Neovim (nvim) using the Lua programming language. The purpose of this repo is to make using Neovim easier with a preconfigured setup that is designed to be fast and easy to use.

## install
```bash
mv $HOME/.config/nvim $HOME/.config/nvim.bak
git clone https://github.com/muryp/nvim-conf-lua --depth=1 $HOME/.config/nvim
nvim
```

## Plugin
see list plugins in [here](./PLUGINS.md)

## Why Choose Neovim?

There are several reasons why we chose Neovim as our text editor of choice. First, Neovim is faster and lighter than Vim. This means that the text editor can be used quickly (good performance for low spec). Additionally, Neovim is also very flexible, allowing it to be customized to the user's needs.
